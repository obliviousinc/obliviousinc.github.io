# Session 3: Greater Sudbury

## Session Summary

During what promises to be a drive of unknown length, the group takes their chance to interrogate Fluke.

Among other things, she reveals that magic is real.

She's apparently part of an organization that tries to keep magic *secret*, and her guarded demeanor and vague answers support that.  The few details our overeager ghost hunters manage to pry out of Fluke include:

* She's tracking someone, evidently Allison.
* Or maybe someone named **Adustus,** who has... possessed Allison?
* No, this is not Harry Potter.
* This Adustus person is a rotten old bastard who survived an execution attempt, and Fluke has been tracking him for weeks.
* There are different types of magic, and she's following Adustus by watching something called his "nimbus."
* *No,* this is *not* Harry Potter. 
* The material world is afflicted with a curse that forces mortals ("sleepers") to utterly disbelieve things like magic; some mortals ("sleepwalkers") are less affected than others, and Fluke is trying to determine who in the group can handle more exposure... and who can't.
* For the last goddamn time, no I'm not an "auror" and *this is not Harry Potter.*

Fluke's best guess is that Adustus has severed Allison's soul and taken up residence in her body, forcing her mind to cower in the dark corners of consciousness.  She will eventually lose her last spark of *self* in this condition, but splitting a soul releases a tremendous amount of energy, so Adustus won't have discarded it.  If it can be recovered in time, so can Allison.

Mercifully, the drive does eventually end, but not before passing through all of Wisconsin, much of Michigan, and well into Ontario.  The final destination, as least as far as Fluke can tell right now:  [Sudbury](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sudbury,+ON,+Canada/@46.5456009,-81.1336316,11z).

From here, the group splits up.  Fluke recovers some energy after her long drive by camping out in a Tim Hortons, while Dewey (who was driving the other car) takes a long nap.

Timmy goes shopping and buys a demolition hammer, which strikes him as a prudent purchase for some reason.

Albacore finds the nearest library and learns about the area.  Plot hook #1:  abandoned mining towns north of the city named Milnet and Sellwood.  Vacation hook #1:  there's a railroad museum nearby in Capreol.

Sammy goes on a binge, drinking at as many bars as he can before ending up at a "hunter bar" called **La Veillée** (["la veje"](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/veill%C3%A9e) for the fancy folks, "lava-lay" to the rest of us).  Plot hook #2:  the hunters here are gossipping about some local politics, and they don't sound normal.

Tim and Dewey join Sam at La Veillée, just in time to watch him drain a cocktail full of vampire blood.  They haul him away before he can do any more damage.
