# Session 1: Oblivious Inc.

![Ropes](/assets/img/hdr/ropes.jpg)

### Some notes about the game:

In most RPG campaigns, the first session is awkward and feels silly and artificial; you all "meet at a tavern" and immediately band together and go on Adventure #1.  We're going to skip that.  Our characters already know each other, and they're part of a club:  a *Paranormal Geek-Out Club* full of Huge Nerds.  They may all come from different walks of life, they may all have different jobs and hobbies most of the time, but they've found each other through shared online interests: they are **Oblivious Incorporated**.

They like to get together every month or two and visit a haunted house, or a famous Satanic bookstore, or an abandoned mental hospital, or the scene of a Civil War battle... looking for creepy clues and puzzles, researching occultic nonsense, or just straight up using their infrared cameras and trying to film ghosts.

The setting is Madison, Wisconsin (and the region surrounding it) in modern day.  No dungeons, dragons, or cyborgs.  The RPG system is the "New" [World of Darkness](http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/World_of_Darkness) (often abbreviated [nWoD](https://www.google.com/search?q=nwod)).  The players have never roleplayed before, and the GM has never run a WoD game before.  It should go flawlessly.

## Session Summary

This "club" consists of mystery addicts and treasure hunters.  They spend an inordinate amount of time looking for ghosts and researching the occult.  Allison tends to be the dynamo at the group's center when it comes to picking out places to visit, organizing trips, etc.  It's the one "Den Mother" activity she actually nails pretty well.

In the past year, Oblivious Inc. has been all around the Midwest:

* [Lemp Mansion](https://the-line-up.com/lemp-family-mansion) in St. Louis, MO
* [Archer Avenue](https://www.ranker.com/list/most-haunted-road-archer-avenue/sabrina-ithal) in Willow Springs, IL
* [Bullock Hotel](http://www.hauntedhouses.com/states/sd/bullock_hotel.htm) in Deadwood, SD
* [Bachelor's Grove Cemetary](https://www.prairieghosts.com/bachgrov.html) in Midlothian, IL
* [Ohio State Reformatory](http://www.deadohio.com/mansfieldreformatory.htm) in Mansfield, OH

The last time anyone saw or heard from Allison was six weeks ago, on the Bachelor's Grove trip.  Their Denny's breakfast was especially greasy in the morning, certain more credulous members of the group swear they saw the "White Lady" in the evening, and a good time was had by all.

The trip to Ohio had already been planned, so when Allison couldn't make it, the group went on ahead without her.

A month has passed since Ohio, and the last adventure Allison had a hand in planning before her absence comes now:  the **Gorman Funeral Home** (*"We Grieve With You"*), an abandoned funeral parlor in a blighted neighborhood of Detroit called [Delray](https://detroit.curbed.com/2018/5/3/17314922/the-origins-demise-delray).

Surprisingly enough, as the group settles in for their traditional Grand Slam (Michigan edition), Allison makes an appearance.
