# Session 2: It's Fluke

![Archer](/assets/img/hdr/archer.jpg)

## Session Summary

On the drive home after their harrowing experience in the Gorman Funeral Home, Oblivious Inc. considers the collected post-trip evidence... which is a taller pile than usual, after their least disappointing ghost hunt yet.

* Albacore's old-fashioned tape recorder reveals that Allison (now missing again) was vocalizing more during the mortuary visit than anyone realized at the time:  constantly muttering to herself, somehow remaining unheard.
* The WiFi locator app on Timmy's phone captured impossible IP addresses (such as the classic `999.999.999.999`) at the home, and Timmy's phone may in fact be haunted at this point.
* Sammy realizes that when he saw Allison knee-deep in the flooded basement, she was surrounded by empty boxes and bottles marked **LIQUOR**, and this probably *wasn't* whiskey or vodka.  Disturbingly, it seems likely Allison was wading through [salty coffin liquor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocere) when they found her.
* Dewey's digital body camera (like the cops use) reveals that **none** of the spooky phenomena were real, and the group was apparently having shared hallucinations... with one exception:  the suit floating in the hallway was definitely, really, actually there.

In the days following Detroit, Timmy notices a [cryptic message](https://www.reddit.com/r/obliviousinc/comments/7deq9v/hi/) on the group's subreddit, apparently posted by Allison's account.  After decoding, it reads:

```
43.079241,-89.384695

Apartment 401

Wednesday, 11 PM

Assholes
```

The GPS coordinates point to an apartment complex in Madison, and the group elects to follow the message's mysterious instructions.  Upon arriving, they find the door unlocked.  They spend a few minutes inspecting Apartment 401, and then they're hit with an eerie feeling that someone else is in the room with them... despite the fact that they can't seem to pinpoint who it is.  After painstakingly counting heads, they discover the mysterious fifth:

![Fluke](/assets/img/npc/sm/fluke1.jpg)

A smallish woman wearing a flak jacket over a flannel shirt is looking very grumpy in the corner.  She introduces herself as "Fluke" (surely not her real name) and claims to know what's going on with Allison, though she isn't especially forthcoming with details.  Meanwhile, a large group of naked people are gathering outside in the street.  This makes Fluke anxious, and she feels they should leave; unfortunately, she's convinced the naked people have infiltrated the apartment building, and the only way out is via the roof.

The naked people are cadavers, walking around without help.  And they do indeed appear to have infiltrated the building, given there are several in the hallway outside.

Our heroes fight their way past the dead men and women, including at least one spectacularly deconstructive kick by Tim, and flee to the roof.  Fluke simply jumps off, landing gracefully in a dumpster full of soft fiberglass insulation.  Sammy attempts to follow, flinging himself over the edge, and nearly lands catastrophically on the *rim* of the dumpster.  Inexplicably, at the last second, a miracle occurs and he lands safely.  The rest of the group descends through a conveniently located waste chute.

All on the ground, everyone piles into the various automobiles present, and begins a sudden drive north out of Madison.  Fluke has her eyes on the road and a destination in mind, and everyone else is feeling quizzical.
